# Why are we using yarn@1.18.0?
# There are cyclical dependency issues surrounding certain packages (like `eslint`) stemming from the use of `tsdx`. `yarn` @ verions >= 1.19.0 have
# issues resolving the different versions of the same libraries in a yarn "workspace" which ensures everybody uses `yarn@1.18.0` - that's this folder.
# More on that: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7807#issuecomment-623223536). Luckily, there's [a workaround](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7807#issuecomment-588632848
