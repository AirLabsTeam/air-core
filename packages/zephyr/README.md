# Zephyr

The official React component library for [Air](https://air.inc).

## Installation

`yarn add -D @air/zephyr`

## Usage

We're assuming you're using this library inside an application setup with `styled-components` (using a ThemeProvider) whose theme object matches the [System UI specification](https://system-ui.com/theme).

Following that, usage should be as simple as:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@air/zephyr';
```
